# Custom Fonts Directory

This directory contains custom fonts used for video subtitle rendering.

## Location Note

- Fonts must be placed in `engine/assets/fonts/` (not root `assets/fonts/`)
- This is required because Docker build context is limited to the `engine/` directory
- When adding new fonts, copy them to this directory before building the Docker image

## Current Fonts

- AlibabaPuHuiTi-3-75-SemiBold.ttf (37MB) - Alibaba PuHuiTi font for subtitle rendering
